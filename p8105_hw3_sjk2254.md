## Problem 1

``` r

# looking at the dataset

insta_df = instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

Instacart is an online grocery shopping service that allows individuals
to shop online from local stores. The platform offers same-day delivery
with purchases being able to be delivered within 2 hours. The `insta_df`
dataset contains the online grocery orders from Instacart users in 2017.
There are 15 variables with 1384617 observations. More specifically, the
dataset has information about identifiers for the order (`order_id`),
product (`product_id`), customer (`user_id`), aisle (`aisle_id`), and
department (`department_id`). Additionally, there is information about
the specific day (`order_dow`) and hour (`order_hour_of_day`) that the
orders were placed.

``` r
# examining the aisles

insta_df |> 
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) |> 
  count() |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle_id, aisle [134]
    ##    aisle_id aisle                              n
    ##       <int> <chr>                          <int>

    ##  2       24 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3      123 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4      120 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5       21 packaged cheese                41699

    ##  7       84 milk                           32644
    ##  8      107 chips pretzels                 31269

    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

The table above shows the the aisles arranged in decreasing order by
most items. Overall, there are 134 different aisles with fresh
vegetables and fruits being the most ordered items.

``` r
# plotting the number of items ordered per aisle

insta_df |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count() |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |>
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
  ggtitle("Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The plot above shows the number of items ordered in each aisle for
aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered. You can see that fresh
vegetables and fruits are the most ordered items because they have the
highest points.
