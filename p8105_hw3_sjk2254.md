Instacart is an online grocery shopping service that allows individuals
to shop online from local stores. The platform offers same-day delivery
with purchases being able to be delivered within 2 hours. The `insta_df`
dataset contains the online grocery orders from Instacart users in 2017.
There are 15 variables with 1384617 observations. More specifically, the
dataset has information about identifiers for the order (`order_id`),
product (`product_id`), customer (`user_id`), aisle (`aisle_id`), and
department (`department_id`). Additionally, there is information about
the specific day (`order_dow`) and hour (`order_hour_of_day`) that the
orders were placed. In total, there are 39123 products found in 131209
orders from 131209 distinct users.

The table above shows the the aisles arranged in decreasing order by
most items. Overall, there are 134 different aisles with fresh
vegetables and fruits being the most ordered items.

``` r

The plot above shows the number of items ordered in each aisle for
aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered. You can see that fresh
vegetables and fruits are the most ordered items because they have the
highest points.

| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |

The table above shows three most popular items in each of the aisles
baking ingredients, dog food care, and packaged vegetables fruits. You
can see that packaged vegetables fruits has the most orders out of the
three aisles.

``` r
# creating a table for ice cream orders

| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

The table above shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. You can see
that on average, Coffee Ice Cream is ordered more than Pink Lady Apples.

``` r

The Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) project uses the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to analyze data from
counties. The BRFSS is a government data set that is primary used to
identify emerging health problems, establish and track health
objectives, and develop and evaluate public health policies and
programs. The dataset (`brfss_df`) has 23 variables with 8500
observations and data ranging from years 2002 to 2010. This dataset
focuses on the health topic “Overall Health”, specifically for responses
from “Poor” to “Excellent”.

``` r
# filtering the data for 2002

brfss_df |> 
  filter(year == "2002") |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |>
  summarise(num_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |> 
  filter(num_locations >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   locationabbr num_locations
    ##   <chr>                <int>
    ## 1 CT                       7
    ## 2 FL                       7
    ## 3 MA                       8
    ## 4 NC                       7

    ## 6 PA                      10

In 2002, 6 states, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA, were observed at 7 or
more locations.

``` r
# filtering the data for 2010

brfss_df |> 
  filter(year == "2010") |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarise(num_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |> 
  filter(num_locations >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 × 2
    ##    locationabbr num_locations
    ##    <chr>                <int>
    ##  1 CA                      12

    ## 14 WA                      10

In 2010, 14 states, CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX,
and WA, were observed at 7 or more locations.

``` r
# creating a a limited dataframe

lm_df =
  brfss_df |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(average_data_value = mean(data_value), .groups = "drop")
```

The above dataframe is limited to “Excellent” responses, and contains,
year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value across
locations within a state.

``` r
# creating a spaghetti plot

lm_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average_data_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Data Value",
    title = "Spaghetti Plot of Average Value Over Time by State"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.3, "lines"), legend.key.height = unit(0.3, "lines"))
```

![](p8105_hw3_sjk2254_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

The “spaghetti” plot above shows the average percentage of individuals
that responded “Excellent” over time within a state. You can see that
there is a lot of fluctuation in all the states and there isn’t an
average greater than 30%.

``` r
# making a two-panel plot

brfss_df |> 
  filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010), locationabbr == "NY") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value, fill = response)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Data Value",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Distribution of Data Value by Response in NY State"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

![](p8105_hw3_sjk2254_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

The two-panel plot above shows the distribution of data value for
responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY state. You can
see that on average, 2010 (right side) had higher data values than 2006
(left side).
